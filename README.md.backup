## Using Fonts


How to add fonts from google to your site

[fonts.google.com](http://fonts.google.com)

The following fonts are used in this project:

---
`Abel`

`Livvic`

`Lexend Deca`

`Josefin Sans`

`Anton`

---


You can `<link>` the fonts, or download the fonts and use use `@import`.


In this instance I downloaded the fonts, and will import them into the HTML file.

once the fonts are donwloaded, extract them into a `fonts` folder in the root directory of your project.

This folder should now be visible in VScode.
In the CSS folder create a file called `fonts.css`

```

/* font-family: Abel */

@font-face {
    font-family: Abel;
    src: url('../fonts/Abel/Abel-Regular.ttf')
}

```  
This is what it should look like when you declare a font. Do this to each of the fonts for the project.
 
Now, in the CSS file:

`@import url(./css/fonts.css')`
 
I should be able to use these fonts now in my HTML document.
 
In the main CSS file this how to change the font for the Title H1
 
`font-family: Abel,cursive;`

# Font Variables 
 
 To make a font variable in your main CSS file go up to the top where the HTML styles are:  

```

:root {
  /* theme font-family */
  --Abel: 'Abel',cursive;
}

```

and then in the CSS where you want the font to be:

`font-family: var(--Abel);` 

use the key word `var` for variable and then put in the name you gave up above where the HTML styles are.

*NOTE: If you are using VScode just type `--name of variable` and VScode will automatically put the ``var` keyword* 


# COLORS

Use color variables.

```
a {
	text-decoration: none;
	color: #3f4959;
}
```

within the root properties like with the fonts place the variable:

`  --text-grey: #3f4954;`

now when I want to use that color on something all I have to do is put `--text-grey` and vs code will make it `var(--text-grey);`
